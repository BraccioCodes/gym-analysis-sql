# gym-analysis-sql

This is the final project for my SQL class in my Data Science course. I am using basic queries in SQLite to perform data analysis on a publicly available data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/gym-check-ins-and-user-metadata) that contains user metadata and check_in information for many different locations. 

This is the dataset's ERD: 


I planned to answer 5 questions using this dataset:
- What's the yearly revenue per location?
- What are the demographics of gym members?
- Which locations have the best athletes? (members that perform higher than the average member)
- What is the average workout duration (min) per workout?
- How is the engagement level per subscription plan?
